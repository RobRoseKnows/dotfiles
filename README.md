# dotfiles

These are my public dotfiles. They've gone through several revisions, originally using 
[dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot), but now using 
[GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/). You can install GNU Stow using your package
manager of choice.

They are somewhat loosely based on @willnorris's [dotfiles](https://github.com/willnorris/dotfiles)
but using oh-my-zsh instead of just zsh.
